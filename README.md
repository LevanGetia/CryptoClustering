# CryptoClustering

K-Means Clustering Challenge


Overview
An exploration of data segmentation using K-Means clustering.

Key Objectives
Apply K-Means clustering on selected features.
Assess the impact of feature selection on cluster integrity.
Visual interpretation of cluster distributions.

Tools
PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Elbow method for optimal cluster count.

Insight
Feature quantity influences cluster accuracy and computation speed.

Note
Evaluate trade-offs between speed and precision when selecting features
